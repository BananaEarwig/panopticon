Intro
=====

Panopticon is a cross platform disassembler for reverse engineering.
It consists of a C++ library for disassembling, analysing decompiling
and patching binaries for various platforms and instruction sets.

Panopticon comes with GUI for browsing control flow graphs, displaying
analysis results, controlling debugger instances and editing the on-disk
as well as in-memory representation of the program.

Building
========

In order to compile Panopticon the following needs to be installed first:

 - Qt 5.3
 - CMake 2.8
 - g++ 4.7 or Clang 3.4
 - Boost 1.53
 - Kyoto Cabinet 1.2.76
 - libarchive 3.1.2

*nix
----

After cloning the repository onto disk, create a build directory and
call cmake and the path to the source as argument. Compile the project
using GNU Make.

> git clone https://github.com/das-labor/panopticon.git
> mkdir panop-build
> cd panop-build
> cmake ../panopticon
> make -j4
> sudo make install

Windows
-------

After installing the prerequisites on Windows use the CMake GUI to
generate Visual Studio project files. Panopticon can be compiled
using VC++ 2013.

**At the moment Visual C++ 2013 crashes while compiling the project.**
