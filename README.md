Intro
=====

Panopticon is a cross platform disassembler for reverse engineering
written in Rust. Panopticon has functions for disassembling, analysing
decompiling and patching binaries for various platforms and instruction
sets.

Panopticon comes with GUI for browsing control flow graphs, displaying
analysis results, controlling debugger instances and editing the on-disk
as well as in-memory representation of the program.

Building
========

Panopticon builds with Rust stable. The only dependencies aside from
a working Rust toolchain and Cargo you need Qt 5.3 installed.

Linux
-----

First install Qt using your package manager.

Ubuntu 13.10 and 14.04:
```bash
sudo apt-get install qt5-default qtdeclarative5-dev libqt5qml-quickcontrols qtdeclarative5-folderlistmodel-plugin qtdeclarative5-settings-plugin
```

Fedora 20:
```bash
sudo yum install qt5-qtdeclarative-devel qt5-qtquickcontrols
```

After that clone the repository onto disk, create a build directory and
use cargo to build everything.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/das-labor/panopticon.git
cd panopticon
cargo build
```

Windows
-------

After installing the Qt API and Rust toolchain Panopticon can be build using cargo.

Running
=======

The current version only supports AVR and has no ELF or PE loader yet.
To test Panopticon you need relocated AVR code. Such a file is prepared in
``tests/data/sosse``.

```bash
cargo run
```
