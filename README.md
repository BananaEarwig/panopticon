Intro
=====

Panopticon is a cross platform disassembler for reverse engineering
written in Rust. Panopticon has functions for disassembling, analysing
decompiling and patching binaries for various platforms and instruction
sets.

Panopticon comes with GUI for browsing control flow graphs, displaying
analysis results, controlling debugger instances and editing the on-disk
as well as in-memory representation of the program.

Building
========

Panopticon builds with Rust stable. The only dependencies aside from
a working Rust 1.7 toolchain and Cargo you need Qt 5.4 and GLPK installed.

Linux
-----

Install Qt using your package manager.

Ubuntu 15.10 and 16.04:
```bash
sudo apt install qt5-default qtdeclarative5-dev \
                 qml-module-qtquick-controls qml-module-qttest \
                 qml-module-qtquick2 qml-module-qtquick-layouts \
                 qml-module-qtgraphicaleffects \
                 qtbase5-private-dev pkg-config \
                 libglpk-dev git build-essential cmake
```

Fedora 22 and 23:
```bash
sudo dnf install qt5-qtdeclarative-devel qt5-qtquickcontrols \
                 qt5-qtgraphicaleffects glpk-devel
```

After that clone the repository onto disk and use cargo to build
everything.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/das-labor/panopticon.git
cd panopticon
cargo build
```

Gentoo:

```bash
layman -a rust
layman -f -o https://raw.github.com/das-labor/labor-overlay/master/labor-overlay -a labor-overlay

emerge -av panopticon
```

Windows
-------

Install the Qt 5.4 SDK, GLPK for Windows and the Rust toolchain
Panopticon can be build using ``cargo build``.

Running
=======

The current version only supports AVR and has no ELF or PE loader yet.
To test Panopticon you need relocated AVR code. Such a file is
prepared in ``tests/data/sosse``.
